| **Pardons for January 6 insurrectionists (Jan 20, 2025).** Trump issued pardons and commutations for individuals convicted of seditious conspiracy, assaulting law enforcement, and obstructing Congress during the January 6 attack, and ordered DOJ to drop remaining prosecutions. These actions eliminated criminal accountability for political violence directed at the constitutional transfer of power. [[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-orders-jan-6-pardons) [[2]](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/trump-jan-6-pardons-legal-implications) | **Legal immunity for Nazi political violence (1933–1934).** After taking power, the Nazi regime shielded SA and party loyalists from prosecution for violence against political opponents, including retroactive legal justifications for murder. Courts were subordinated to regime loyalty rather than rule of law. [[3]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nazi-police-state) [[4]](https://www.britannica.com/event/Night-of-the-Long-Knives) | In both cases, violence in service of the ruling movement is reframed as legitimate. U.S. escalation signals include calls from Trump allies to prosecute judges and prosecutors involved in January 6 cases. [[5]](https://apnews.com/article/trump-jan-6-prosecutors-retaliation-2025)                                     | **Project 2025 DOJ chapter** calls for ending “politicized prosecutions” and reorienting DOJ to defend the executive against “lawfare,” explicitly justifying non-enforcement against allies.

| **Border “national emergency” and expanded deportation authority (Jan 20, 2025).** Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, expanded expedited removals, suspended asylum processing, and authorized broad domestic deployment of federal forces. Legal scholars warned the order bypassed statutory protections and due-process guarantees. [[7]](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-border-emergency-explained) [[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-border-emergency.html)                                                              | **Reichstag Fire Decree (Feb 28, 1933).** Hitler invoked emergency powers under Article 48 to suspend habeas corpus, free expression, and assembly, enabling detention without trial and destruction of political opposition. [[9]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/reichstag-fire-decree)                                                                                                                                                          | Both rely on framing an internal population as an existential threat to justify permanent emergency powers. U.S. officials have explicitly described migration as an “invasion,” signaling further suspension of civil protections. [[10]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-allies-call-migrants-invaders-2025-02-02/) | **Project 2025 DHS & immigration chapters** call for invoking emergency authorities to override asylum law and expand interior enforcement, treating legal constraints as obstacles to be neutralized. [[11]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-5.pdf) |
| **Executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship (Jan 20, 2025).** Trump ordered federal agencies to deny citizenship recognition to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, despite the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal courts immediately blocked the order as unconstitutional. [[12]](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/trump-birthright-citizenship-order) [[13]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-01-23/)                                                                                                                             | **Nuremberg Laws (1935).** Nazi Germany stripped Jews of German citizenship, redefining the nation as racially exclusive and rendering millions legally rightless. [[14]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nuremberg-laws)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Both redefine citizenship to exclude targeted groups. U.S. escalation signals include calls to amend or “reinterpret” the Constitution to permanently deny citizenship to children of immigrants.

| **Termination of all federal DEI programs (Jan 20, 2025).** Trump ordered the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices across federal agencies, removed civil-rights guidance, and purged DEI language from official materials. Civil-rights organizations warned this dismantled enforcement mechanisms for anti-discrimination law. [[17]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/executive-order-ending-dei/) [[18]](https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/dei-executive-order-impact/)                                                                                     | **Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (Apr 1933).** Nazi authorities purged Jews and political opponents from civil-service positions, redefining neutrality as ideological loyalty to the regime. [[19]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/law-for-the-restoration-of-the-professional-civil-service)                                                                                                                          | Both dismantle institutional protections for targeted groups. GOP leaders have since called for extending DEI bans to universities and private corporations. [[20]](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/12/republicans-expand-dei-bans-00140567)                                                                           | **Project 2025 personnel chapters** call for purging the civil service of “ideological actors” and reinstating loyalty-based appointment systems. [[21]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-2.pdf)                                                      |
| **Federal pressure on universities and students (Jan–Feb 2025).** The administration threatened universities with loss of federal funding and targeted non-citizen students for deportation based on protected political speech. Academic-freedom groups warned of surveillance and chilling effects. [[22]](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trump-universities-student-activism.html) [[23]](https://www.aaup.org/news/trump-actions-threaten-academic-freedom)                                                                                                                                 | **Nazi Gleichschaltung of universities (1933 onward).** Jewish professors and dissidents were expelled, curricula rewritten, and universities subordinated to Nazi ideology. [[24]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/education-in-the-third-reich)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Both treat education as a site of ideological enforcement. U.S. officials have called for banning gender studies and “subversive” disciplines outright.

| **Attacks on press freedom and retaliatory regulation (2025).** Trump restricted press access, threatened broadcast licenses, sued media outlets, and launched a White House “media bias” reporting portal. Press-freedom organizations warned of retaliatory enforcement. [[27]](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trump-media-bias-portal.php) [[28]](https://cpj.org/2025/03/us-press-freedom-under-threat/)                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Reich Press Law (Oct 1933).** Nazi authorities shuttered opposition newspapers, imposed racial and political requirements on journalists, and centralized media under state control. [[29]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/censorship-and-propaganda)                                                                                                                                                                                            | Delegitimization and economic pressure precede formal censorship. Trump allies have publicly called for jailing journalists and revoking licenses.

| **Defunding of NPR and PBS (May 2025).** Trump ordered termination of federal funding for public broadcasters, citing ideological bias. Media scholars described the move as economic censorship aimed at weakening critical outlets. [[32]](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/trump-defunds-npr-pbs) [[33]](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/defunding-public-media-authoritarian-playbook.php)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Economic strangulation of independent media (1933–1934).** Nazi authorities cut access to licenses, advertising, and paper supplies for non-aligned outlets, forcing closures without formal bans. [[34]](https://www.britannica.com/topic/censorship/Nazi-Germany)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Economic pressure preserves plausible deniability while suppressing dissent. U.S. officials have proposed extending defunding to NGOs and universities.

| **Intimidation & targeting of law firms and lawyers (2025–2026).** The Trump administration and aligned officials pursued investigations, subpoenas, and public pressure against law firms and lawyers representing migrants, corporations, and government critics — including threats of disciplinary action, IRS scrutiny, and reputational attacks. Reports indicate that lawyers defending asylum seekers, corporate challengers to policy, and critics faced enhanced regulatory threat and public denunciation. [[37]](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/politics/trump-admin-targets-law-firms/index.html)                                                                                                                                                         | **People’s Court and Sondergerichte (1933–1945).** Nazi Germany established special courts that prosecuted political opponents and their defenders, and lawyers representing “enemies of the state” were harassed, barred from practice, or punished; regime loyalists dominated legal institutions. Defending certain clients could lead to disbarment. [[38]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/special-courts)                                                             | Both contexts show political power being used to pressure or intimidate legal counsel for government opponents. Signals from U.S. officials praising legal retaliation and calling for expanded disciplinary actions against dissent-related lawyers raise concerns about normalization of legal intimidation. [[39]](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/politics/legal-intimidation-critics.html) | **Project 2025 DOJ & legal enforcement chapters** advocate broad prosecutorial discretion and reinterpretations of legal ethics rules, which could enable expanded investigations of lawyers representing politically non-aligned clients. [[40]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-17.pdf) |
| **Corporate donors currying favor via inaugural contributions (2025).** Business interests committed tens of millions to the Trump inauguration fund, luxury ballrooms, and exclusive events; analysis shows donors often received enhanced access to senior officials and influence opportunities tied to policy priorities. Reports detail corporate executives giving large sums to a private inauguration fund run by allies of the president, which critics called a “pay-to-play” dynamic with potential for regulatory favor or contract advantage. [[41]](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/537678/corporate-interests-commit-millions-to-celebrate-trump-s-inauguration) [[42]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ballroom-donors-white-house-stand-to-gain/) | **Weimar & early Nazi patronage networks (1920s–1930s).** Industrial and corporate leaders in Germany (e.g., Krupp, Thyssen) financially supported Nazi political campaigns and party events in exchange for privileged access and influence over economic and labor policy; after 1933, these relationships translated into favorable contracts and government alignment. [[43]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/industry-and-the-nazi-state)                              | Both involve wealthy entities providing financial support with implied or explicit expectation of policy influence.

| **Foreign nation currying favor (Air Force One negotiation, 2025).** Qatar reportedly offered to supply a new Air Force One (former Qatari airliner) to the U.S. at substantial cost, with the understanding that security coordination and diplomatic favor would be part of the arrangement; critics argued it created an appearance of foreign influence tied to luxury procurement and presidential optics. The deal raised concerns that a foreign state was leveraging strategic gifts to shape access and posture in U.S. policy circles.

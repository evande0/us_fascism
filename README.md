## Caveat: This is a rough draft

These tables have been drafted with help from ChatGPT. I provided a list of current events to address as well as seed sources for those events, but only a handful of comparisons with Nazi Germany. Most of that (as well as Project 2025 data) has been generated and should be checked carefully.  I haven't not yet had time to thoroughly check every source so please do your own verification before using any information provided here!

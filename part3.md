| **Attempted deployment of National Guard without state governor consent.** The Trump administration attempted to federalize large numbers of National Guard troops and deploy them for immigration enforcement and civil disturbances in states whose governors did not consent, raising constitutional questions about state sovereignty and federalism. Legal experts at the Brennan Center argued presidential “call out” power is not a blank check and requires statutory and constitutional limits, and several governors sought injunctions to block these deployments. [[1]](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/presidents-power-call-out-national-guard-not-blank-check) [[2]](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/03/portland-protests-court-national-guard-case/) | **Weimar political use of armed groups (1920s–1930s).** During the unstable late Weimar Republic, governments and paramilitary groups (e.g., Freikorps) were frequently used to suppress opposition without clear legal mandate, contributing to erosion of constitutional norms and civilian control over force. While not a National Guard equivalent, the pattern reflects misuse of armed force beyond its legal framework. | Both involve attempts to circumvent legally defined controls on armed forces; in the U.S. case, governors and courts pushed back. Allied statements in 2025 explicitly framed immigration as “domestic warfare,” signaling willingness to treat nonconsensual deployments as routine. [[3]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-allies-call-migrants-invaders-2025-02-02/)                    | **Project 2025 civil-military chapters** emphasize reinforcing executive authority over domestic deployment and interior security but do not clearly reaffirm statutory limits or governor consent, risking normalization of non-consensual federal troop use. [[4]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-5.pdf)              |
| **Culling & premature removal of senior military leaders.** The Pentagon under Secretary Hegseth oversaw the firing or departure of high-ranking military officials, including the head of Defense Intelligence and the commander of U.S. Southern Command, reportedly amid disagreement with administration policy direction and without typical transition norms. Critics described these departures as politically motivated purges that weaken professional military continuity and politicize senior command. [[5]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/latest-purge-hegseth-removes-head-pentagon-intelligence-agency-other-senior-2025-08-22/) [[6]](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/dec/12/us-admiral-leading-us-troops-in-latin-america-step/)                                       | **Nazi consolidation of military leadership (1933–1934).** After coming to power, Hitler and Nazi leadership pressured or removed senior professional officers perceived as disloyal to align the Reichswehr with party aims, undermining independent military advice and centralizing loyalty to the regime.                                                                                                                   | Both examples show political imperatives supplanting established professional command norms. In the U.S. context, supporters of further military alignment with ideological goals have publicly discussed replacing leaders who disagree, signalling continued politicization. [[7]](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/politics/legal-intimidation-critics.html)                             | **Project 2025 defense and personnel chapters** call for restructuring military leadership and increasing accountability to civilian leadership, which proponents say improves alignment with policy goals but critics warn could further politicize career military ranks. [[8]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-2.pdf) |
| **Politicized gatherings of military leaders & threats to fire dissenting generals.** At a senior military leadership meeting, Trump and Hegseth publicly suggested possible use of the U.S. military for domestic security in U.S. cities, and media reported threats to fire generals who disagreed with these plans. These comments drew criticism from Pentagon advisers and Congress, as they blur the traditionally strict apolitical role of the U.S. armed forces. [[9]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/at-gathering-of-military-leaders-trump-hints-at-deployment-in-u-s-cities) [[10]](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-senator-mark-kelly-sues-pentagon-chief-hegseth-over-demotion-threats-2026-01-12/)                                                                 | **Night of the Long Knives & SS/SA/Army reorganization (1934).** Hitler orchestrated a purge and reorganization of paramilitary and military leadership to ensure loyalty, using threats and violence to discipline those who disagreed with Nazi goals; this dismantled professional autonomy and instilled fear of opposing leadership.                                                                                       | Both involve public pressure and threats against military leaders for not aligning with political leadership’s goals. In the U.S., lawmakers and commentators have since debated removing protections that shield military dissent, signaling potential further erosion of apolitical norms. [[11]](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/05/debates-over-military-dissent-protections-00131056) | **Project 2025 defense chapters** advocate enhanced civilian oversight and alignment but lack specific protections for dissenting professional opinions, which critics argue could entrench political loyalty tests within the armed forces.

| **Maritime strikes on boats in international waters.** U.S. forces carried out strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats in international waters near Venezuela, killing crew and civilians; human rights and maritime law experts characterized these as extrajudicial killings that violated international human rights and maritime law by failing to meet necessity and proportionality standards. [[12]](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/18/us-maritime-strikes-amount-extrajudicial-killings) [[13]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/un-human-rights-chief-says-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats-unacceptable)                                                                                                                                                                 | **Unrestricted submarine warfare (WWII era).** In WWII, belligerents such as Germany conducted naval warfare against civilian and neutral shipping in international waters, often without warning, which was widely condemned and contributed to legal norms against indiscriminate maritime force.                                                                                                                             | Both involve the use of lethal force in international waters without clear lawful justification. In the U.S. case, some policymakers celebrated the strikes as deterrence, signaling potential expansion of similar operations without stricter legal constraints. [[14]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/analysis-legal-implications-us-high-seas-strikes-2025-09-20/)                         | **Project 2025 national security chapters** call for robust defense operations against transnational threats, but do not clearly delineate compliance requirements with existing maritime law, raising concerns about unchecked use of force. [[15]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-7.pdf)                              |
| **Using military force to depose the leader of an independent state (Venezuela, 2026).** U.S. forces conducted an operation in Venezuela to arrest President Nicolás Maduro and his wife without consent from the Venezuelan government, drawing condemnation from U.N. human rights experts and international law scholars who said it violated the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on forcible change of government absent Security Council authorization. [[16]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/maduro-international-law-memo) [[17]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2026/01/mil-260107-ohchr01.htm)                                                                                                                                                         | **Nazi invasions of Austria & Czechoslovakia (1938–1939).** Nazi Germany used military force to subsume Austria (Anschluss) and occupy Czechoslovakia without legitimate legal basis, violating international agreements and sovereignty norms, contributing to outbreak of broader conflict.                                                                                                                                   | Both involve military incursions into sovereign states without clear legal authorization. U.S. legislators have since debated reaffirming Congressional authority over such operations, indicating concern about executive unilateralism in using force abroad. [[18]](https://time.com/7344716/war-powers-act-senate-trump-venezuela/)                                                          | **Project 2025 foreign policy chapters** emphasize assertive use of U.S. military in hemispheric security, but do not specify mechanisms to ensure U.N. or Congressional authorization for regime change operations. [[15]](https://static.project2025.org/mandate/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-7.pdf)                                                       |
| **Act of war on independent nation without Congressional declaration of war (2026).** The U.S. Senate voted to constrain further military actions in Venezuela under the War Powers framework, implicitly acknowledging that prior major military operations lacked explicit Congressional authorization — a constitutional requirement for declarations of war. [[18]](https://time.com/7344716/war-powers-act-senate-trump-venezuela/) [[19]](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senate-vote-reining-trump-venezuela-2026-01-08/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Nazi rearmament and expansion (1938–1939).** Nazi Germany’s expansionist military actions preceding WWII were conducted without legal declarations, flouting both German constitutional constraints and international agreements, contributing to collapse of legal order in Europe.                                                                                                                                          | Both contexts reveal executive use of major military force without clear legislative authorization, raising constitutional and international legitimacy concerns. U.S. critics have argued this undermines the War Powers Clause and invites unchecked executive war-making. [[20]](https://www.heritage.org/war-powers/report/war-powers-constitutional-history-and-overview)                   | **Project 2025 defense & foreign affairs chapters** promote rapid response force authority but lack clear requirements for prior Congressional authorization before major military engagements.

| **Using military to extract resources from another country (Venezuela).** After the Venezuelan operation, U.S. authorities and interim leaders took control of Venezuela’s oil production and export infrastructure, planning to direct proceeds for reconstruction and debt obligations; human rights organizations said this amounted to exerting control over another country’s resources, in violation of sovereign rights under international law.

In the U.S. case, critics have called for clearer legal prohibitions against resource capture in conjunction with military operations.

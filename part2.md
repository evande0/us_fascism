| **Medical neglect & deaths in ICE custody (2025–2026).** Multiple reports document systemic denial of urgent medical care in ICE detention, including delays or denials of insulin, asthma medications, and treatment for life-threatening conditions, leading to serious harm and deaths in custody. A record number of **32 individuals died in ICE custody in 2025**, followed by additional deaths in early 2026 as detention surged. Experts link overcrowding and inadequate medical care to these fatal outcomes. [[1]](https://apnews.com/article/e218486607c04040c94561699e1d0054) | **Nazi concentration camps (1933–1945).** Nazi authorities detained millions in camps where intentional neglect of medical care, starvation, and forced labor caused massive mortality among Jews, Roma, political prisoners, and others. Deaths from deliberate medical neglect were a central mechanism of oppression and genocide. [[2]](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-camps) | Both involve detainees held without adequate healthcare; while scale and intent differ, systemic neglect resulting in death draws structural comparison. U.S. political actors have endorsed continued expansion of detention capacity despite known neglect findings. [[3]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/07/trump-immigration-ice-shootings) | **Project 2025 DHS & immigration enforcement plans** call for expanded detention capacity, streamlined removals, and interior enforcement; they do not include independent oversight provisions to guarantee adequate medical care within expanded facilities. [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) |
| **Overcrowding, lack of hygiene, contaminated food/water.** Investigations found detainees sleeping on cold concrete floors without bedding, substandard food quality, limited clean water, and unsanitary conditions including overflowing toilets and insect infestations, conditions that risk disease and violate standards.

| **Degrading and punitive treatment (shackling, isolation).** Detainees reported shackling during long transports without food or water, denial of showers, and isolation-like conditions; Human Rights Watch described practices that go beyond administrative custody into punitive treatment.

| **Secretive extended short-term confinement.** Investigative reporting revealed ICE holds detainees for days or weeks in small concrete holding cells without beds or outdoor exercise, with continuous lights and limited contact with lawyers or family, violating ICE’s own policies on short-term holding.
